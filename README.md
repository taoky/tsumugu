# tsumugu

A HTTP(S) syncing tool with lower overhead, for OSS mirrors.

Instead of `HEAD`ing every single file, tsumugu parses directory listing HTML and downloads only files that do not seem to be up-to-date.

## Design goals

To successfully sync from these domains, where lftp/rclone fails or finds difficulties:

- [x] http://download.proxmox.com/
- [x] https://download.docker.com/
- [x] https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/

## TODOs

- [x] Add "--include": Sync even if the file is excluded by `--exclude` regex.
- [x] Add supported Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora and RHEL versions support to `--include` regex.
  - Something like `--include debian/${DEBIAN_VERSIONS}`?
- [x] Check for APT/YUM repo integrity (avoid keeping old invalid metadata files)
  - (This is experimental and may not work well)

## Building with musl

Unfortunately, this requires openssl-sys, which is not included in cross's prebuilt images. Try https://github.com/clux/muslrust.

## Evaluation

Default concurrency is 2 threads.

### http://download.proxmox.com/

Proxmox uses a self-hosted CDN server architecture, and unfortunately its server limits concurrency to only 1 (as far as I could test). With traditional lftp/rclone it could take > 10 hours to sync once (even when your local files are identical with remote ones).

Note: Consider using [Proxmox Offline Mirror](https://pom.proxmox.com/) or other tools like `apt-mirror` if you only need its APT repository.

```console
> time ./tsumugu sync --threads 1 --dry-run --exclude '^temp' http://download.proxmox.com/ /srv/repo/proxmox/
...

real	1m48.746s
user	0m3.468s
sys	0m3.385s
```

### https://download.docker.com/

We use [a special script](https://github.com/ustclug/ustcmirror-images/blob/master/docker-ce/tunasync/sync.py) for syncing docker-ce before, but tsumugu can also handle this now. And also, for 30x inside linux/centos/ and linux/rhel/, tsumugu could create symlinks as what this script do before.

```console
> time ./tsumugu sync --timezone-file https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce-staging.repo --parser docker --dry-run https://download.docker.com/ /srv/repo/docker-ce/
...

real	8m32.674s
user	0m4.532s
sys	0m2.855s
```

### https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/

lftp/rclone fails to handle complex HTML.

```console
> time ./tsumugu sync --parser apache-f2 --dry-run --exclude '^mageia' --exclude '^macosx' --exclude '^debian' --exclude '^ubuntu' --exclude '^fedora' --include '^debian/dists/${DEBIAN_CURRENT}' --include '^ubuntu/dists/${UBUNTU_LTS}' --include '^fedora/${FEDORA_CURRENT}' https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/ /srv/repo/wine/wine-builds/
...

<TIMESTAMP>  INFO ThreadId(01) tsumugu: (Estimated) Total objects: 17514, total size: 342.28 GiB

## Notes

### Yuki integration

See <https://github.com/ustclug/ustcmirror-images#tsumugu>.

YAML example:

```yaml
envs:
  UPSTREAM: http://download.proxmox.com/
  # tsumugu is not in yuki supported upstream image yet, so this is a workaround to correctly display the upstream URL
  $UPSTREAM: http://download.proxmox.com/
  TSUMUGU_EXCLUDE: --exclude ^temp --exclude pmg/dists/.+changelog$ --exclude devel/dists/.+changelog$
  TSUMUGU_TIMEZONEFILE: http://download.proxmox.com/images/aplinfo.dat
  TSUMUGU_THREADS: 1
image: ustcmirror/tsumugu:latest
interval: 12 3 * * *
logRotCycle: 10
name: proxmox
storageDir: /srv/repo/proxmox/
```

### Regex variables

See [./src/regex_process.rs](./src/regex_process.rs).

### Exclusion and inclusion

Currently tsumugu follows a simple algorithm to determine whether a path should be completely excluded, partially excluded, or included:

0. When parsing regex, a "rev_inner" regex will be generated by replacing variables (`${UBUNTU_LTS}`, etc.) to `(?<distro_ver>.+)`.
1. First, users' exclusions and inclusions are preprocessed. For all exclusions, if it is a prefix of any inclusion, it will be put into the `list_only_regexes`, otherwise it will be put into `instant_stop_regexes`.
2. While working threads are handling listing requests, they will first check if it matches any inclusions regexes. If not so, check if the path matches any `instant_stop_regexes`. If so, the path will be completely excluded. Then, the path will be checked with "rev_inner" regex, and also completely excluded if matches (a fast shortcut). Finally, if the path matches `list_only_regexes`, files under this directory will be ignored, but subdirectories will still be listed. Paths that are not matched by any regexes will be included as usual.

In this process some paths, which would be unnecessary, will still be listed. Consider it as a trade-off for simplicity and performance.

## Naming

The name "tsumugu", and current branch name "pudding", are derived from the manga *A Drift Girl and a Noble Moon*.

Tsumugu in the appearance of a very simplified version of Hitori (Obviously I am not very good at drawing though).

Old (2020), unfinished golang version is named as "traverse", under the `main-old` branch.
